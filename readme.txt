6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
We designed this app mainly for the middle-age people who want to improve their sleep without 
using any medication.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
We designed the app for both iOS and Android.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
We only support manually logging. User can log it whenever they want. This is very easy for user but
it might create unnecessary duplicated data. This is not the best approach for this problem
but we don't really have enough time to implement it in other approach.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
User can log sleepiness whenever they want in a day. It can be access easily by click on the tab Daily Log in our app.
We think this is a direct and simple way for user to log their sleepiness.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
User can view the data by clicking on the tab Statistics. It shows the sleeping time and and the logs user has logged.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
We used Ionic Storage to store the data.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?



13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?



14. Did you add any "extra" features, such as other data to log, the ability to edit or delete data, or changes to the styling of the app? If so, what did you add? How do these add to the experience of the app?
