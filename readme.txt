- We implemented a Log in page, after users successfully log in, the app will lead to the Home page that contains 4 tabs (Sleep Track, Sleep Log, Sleep Data, and User Profile). Users can log out when they finish their sections or they can stay logged in.
- In Sleep Data, we added the ability to delete the logged data. After data deleted, users have 5 seconds to undo the delete.
- We also implemented the profile page where user information is displayed.
